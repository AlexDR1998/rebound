    "The setup script will download the latest version of REBOUND from PyPI, compile the C code in the background and place all the files in their correct location in the virtual environment. No other libraries are needed to start working with WHFast and REBOUND, but you might want to install numpy and matplotlib to be able to post-process your data and make plots. Installing those libraries is also very easy (but may need a few minutes to compile):\n",
