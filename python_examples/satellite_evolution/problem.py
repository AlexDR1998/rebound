In this example, we initialize a sparse circumplanetary disk of satellites 
around a planet orbiting the Sun. The initial outer edge of the disk extends 
to the Hill radius of the planet. We integrate to study the evolution of 
satellites under the influence of the planet and solar gravitational potentials.
